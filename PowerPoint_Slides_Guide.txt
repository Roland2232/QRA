SLIDE 5: REVIEW OF SIMILAR PROJECTS
----------------------------------
TITLE: Literature Review - Existing Solutions

COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS:
• Google Classroom Attendance - Basic, limited location features
• Classcraft - Gamified but complex
• Socrative - Quiz-focused with basic tracking

ACADEMIC RESEARCH:
• RFID-Based Systems - Hardware dependency, higher costs
• Face Recognition - Privacy concerns, lighting issues
• Bluetooth Proximity - Battery drain, limited range

QR CODE SOLUTIONS:
• QR Attendance (GitHub) - Limited user management
• Smart Attendance - Lacks location verification
• EduTrack - Not mobile-optimized

GAPS IDENTIFIED:
✗ Limited multi-role management
✗ No real-time location verification
✗ Poor mobile responsiveness
✗ Insufficient analytics

OUR ADVANTAGES:
